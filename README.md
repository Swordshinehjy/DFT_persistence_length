# Persistence Length of Semiflexible Conjugated Polymers using the Improved Hindered Rotation Model

## Introduction

The reference paper [Predicting Chain Dimensions of Semiflexible Polymers from Dihedral Potentials](https://doi.org/10.1021/ma500923r) provides a detailed explanation of the method. The orginal codes were written in Mathematica. This repository aims to replicate the results using Python with code optimization.

* Code Optimization

  - Load external dihedral potential files.
  - Replace cos polyfit with cubic spline.
  - Replace recursion with cumsum.
  - Replace for loop with vectorization.
  - Calculation with 20 repeat units and 50000 samples can be done within 30 seconds.
* New Features
  - Experimental codes for (A-D1)x-(A-D2)1-x terpolymers (now only work with similar terminal units, e.g., in the demo, D1 = dithenylethene, D2 = ethanediyldithiophene, both are thiophene terminal units)
  - Copolymers containing asymetric units in random or alternating connecting modes

## Requirements

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
